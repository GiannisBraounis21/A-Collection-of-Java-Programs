### Mail Simulator
An application that creates a mini mail server in order to send and receive emails.

### What have I learned.
- Create multiple classes and have the work together
- How public , private and static fields and methods of a class works.
- "this" keyword to refer a field or to invoke a constructor of the class
- Passing and returning object in a function
